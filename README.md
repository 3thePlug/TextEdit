## Text editor

Hello! this is a simple school project (JavaFX intro). It consists on a simple editor like notepad from windows and allows you to save and load .txt docs.

## Wanna know

This project is developed in the text editor Microsoft Visual Studio Code. If you need another folder structure for another IDE just contact me.

## Structure

Well, the workspace has the following directories:

- `src`: the folder which contains the source code:
    - `model`: still empty, allows to use classes
    - `controller`: contains the main program and the view controllers
    - `view`: it only have two views, the main one and an experimental added (About the program)
- `lib`: it contains the necessary JavaFX libraries compiled

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

There is also a vscode directory in which you have the JSON files settings and launch. There you can change the JavaFX sdk path and the folder where are generated the compiled files.
